<h1>The Game Engine</h1>
<p>
At the moment, this project is unfinished and unavailable to the public. As of right now, I have already spent about a year working on it and it's been by far the biggest project I have worked on so far. It is also the one I am most excited about.

<b>NOTE (15.08.2025):</b><br><br>
Compared to my relatively short net time of work experience, this project is already one of the older ones. Over the past 1.5 years while working on this project, I have significantly improved as a programmer and there is some baggage in terms of bad design choices that I've made in the past, that is not easy to get rid of. Additionally, Rust is a language that, even if it does some things right, is not really helping one solve the hard problems that arise when making games - quite the contrary actually.
I don't want to downplay the progress that I've made so far, though.
The state of the project is already quite substancial. In the near future, most likely, there will be a major rewrite to a different language.
From that point on, updating the current state of the engine (that will still be missing some features) will not be a high priority for me (that might change over time). Still, I will be making that version public and might publish a more mature version of the re-made engine in the future. That will take some time though.

If you are interested in taking a look at that work (it is probably the best work that I have done so far) before it is publicly available, just contact me.
