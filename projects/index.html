                The Leafy Game Engine<br>
                <i>
                    A 3D and 2D code-focussed Game Engine designed to be a great starting point for building games in Rust using little external dependecies. I am using this project as a giant learning experience in the game development world. It is not in a stable state and is still being worked on. More info on this page.

                Zlider: A Simple Slide Show Program<br>
                <i>
                    I always resented the way most slide show programs work - a pay wall, a file format with seemingly non-deterministic formatting output or poor open source alternatives. This slide show program is all I need for almost all use cases and uses text files and a simple "markup language" for the slide show files and also offers some other features that come in handy.

                McNaughton-Zielonka Algorithm<br>
                <i>
                    In the winter semester 2024/25 of University I was studying a Master's module about the latest research regarding Parity Games. I implemented an algorithm that we discussed during the lectures to help me understand the concepts. This page also includes some introductory material to the field.

                    The first bigger Software Development Project I worked on in University. I decided to use it for taking my first steps in the graphics programming world. It combined an algorithmic problem with a game mechanic.
