                Custom Jai Modules<br>
                <i>
                    Over the course of many months of me being a part of the Jai beta program and working on video games, I accumulated a bunch of custom modules that I use all the time. This is just a quick showcase of the most notable parts using a few code snippets. This page will be updated when new notable things get released.

                Zlider: A Simple Slide Show Program<br>
                <i>
                    I always resented the way most slide show programs work - a pay wall, a file format with seemingly non-deterministic formatting output or poor open source alternatives. This slide show program is all I need for almost all use cases and uses text files and a simple "markup language" for the slide show files.

                    The first actual Software Development Project I worked on in University. I decided to use it for taking my first steps in the graphics programming world. It combined an algorithmic problem with a game mechanic. This article was written in retrospect.
