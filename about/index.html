My name is Luca Thomas and I am a Computer Science student in Germany at the <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/">Technical University of Braunschweig</a>. I am engaged in doing my Bachelors degree at the moment, but alongside my studies at university, I am almost always working on something on the side privately. I decided to start this blog to showcase the work that I have been doing and enable others to quickly learn more about it. As I come along some interesting topics while working on my projects, I might write some articles about them here and there if I think that they might be interesting to other people.

I am both a technical and creative person at heart and I want to pursue meaningful work. I am very much involved in the game development space, both in regards to design and technical things about tools and engines. I see it as the best combination of both of these worlds. Generally, I am a systems programming person. A major motivation of mine is to make the software world a less terrible place. I want to become the most competent person I can be and love to work on hard problems. I am constantly trying to learn as much as I can and I hope that never stops.
