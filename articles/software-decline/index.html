<h1>On Pitfalls in Software Development Culture and Project Management</h1>

As part of a small side module I took in university about project management in software development, me and the person mentioned in the document worked on this essay about the decline in modern software quality and the potential pitfalls of common project management practices. I figured, it might me interesting to post part of it here. It is in German.
